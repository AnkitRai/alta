      "The Art of Literary Text Analysis (ALTA) has two primary objectives. First, it is designed as a guide to provide a gentle introduction to concepts and methodologies for literary text analysis with computers \u2013 it is meant to be very welcoming to newcomers to digital tools for the study of texts. Second, the guide is intended to offer a glimpse of the wide range of possible techniques for using tools to study texts \u2013 if it cannot hope to explain and demonstrate everything, it at least has the ambition of suggesting the breadth of possibilities and providing a helpful foundation for further exploration and experimentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This instance of The Art of Literary Text Analysis is created in iPython Notebooks. Other choices are available, and many conceptual aspects of the guide are relevant regardless of the implementation. iPython Notebooks was chosen for three main reasons: 1) python (the programming language used in iPython Notebooks) features extensive support for text analysis and natural language processing; 2) python is not a bad programming language to learn for those encountering programming for the first time \u2013 it's not easy, but it represents a good balance between power, speed, readability and learnability; 3) iPython Notebooks offers a _literate programming_ model of writing where blocks of prose text (like this one) can be interspersed with bits of code and output. _The Art of Literary Text Analysis_ focuses on process, and the documentation-rich format offered by iPython Notebooks is well-suited to the nature of this guide."
